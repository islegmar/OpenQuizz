# Roadmap

## Done

- Refactor the communication client / server and the message broadcasting

## Pending

- Create a "all.json" with all the list of URLs, so it is easier to update (keep always the possibility of entering manually the URL)
- When showing the data Source, show <Name>,<URL>
- Rename the project to openquizz
- More spacing in lyPlay (borders)
- Another visual element when end of game (Game Over and who wins)
- Add a more visual support por the remaining time (eg. color bar)
- Add support to twitter: read the messages @<me>: <question> #true/#false that are questions the type true/false
- Keep JSON with the questions in the Database, so it is not needed to reload them if not needed. Use some "cache" mechism to know if a Data Source must be reloaded or not.
